# Scrapper

This project has been created to speed up a ver specific task in a very specific company.
For security reasons i erase all sensitive data from the scope of this repository, since is a project that just meant to run in local machines.

## Ahievements

- The main purpose of this project is to speed up the collection of monthly required data, in order to deliver client reports faster, eliminating human errors from the equation.
- From **two days** of data collecting, now it takes **7 minutes** thanks to *web scrapping*.
- I can retrieve specific clients **one by one**, a **custom selection** of my choice or the **entire list** of clients *in 7 minutes*, improving my capacity to early detect any data anomaly.
